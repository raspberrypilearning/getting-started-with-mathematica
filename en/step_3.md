## Getting started with Mathematica

Mathematica is a computational programming tool used in science, maths, computing and engineering, first released in 1988. It is proprietary software that you can use for free on the Raspberry Pi and has been bundled with Raspbian and NOOBS since late 2013.

If you do not have the Wolfram Language and Mathematica already installed, you can download them to your Raspberry Pi for free by entering the following commands into a terminal window and pressing Enter after each:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wolfram-engine
```
