## What you will make
In this resource you will be introduced to Mathematica and the Wolfram language, which are available for free on the Raspberry Pi.

Mathematica is a computational programming tool used in science, maths, computing and engineering. It was first released in 1988. It is proprietary software that you can use for free on the Raspberry Pi and comes bundled for free with Raspbian. Mathematica is generally used for coding projects at university level and above.
